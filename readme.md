# Locust.IO Demos
This project has a few demos of how to use locust.io to load test
various services. This has three main components:

* REST Service - demonstrates the default behavior of load testing a
  RESTful service
* Memcached - demonstrates loadtesting a memcached instance
* AMQP - demonstrates using locust.io to flood a rabbitmq broker with
  AMQP messages.


## Running the Samples
All of these samples run locally using docker.
